Replace the placeholder for the image with ![alt text](the URL you got) so that you can insert the image as an image into the .md file. Also mention the bloom's taxonomy level for each question. Make sure to align headings, Subheadings, images etc into the center, and divide it into sections such as section 1 for MCQ, Section 2 for Descriptive and section 3 for Diagram based questions. Also use proper margins. Make sure to put the options for MCQ questions in a new line rather than the same line as the question"
