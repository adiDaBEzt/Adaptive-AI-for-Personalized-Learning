# Operating Systems Question Paper

**Instructions:** Answer all questions.

**Section 1: Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)**

    a)  Predictable response time
    b)  Fast context switching
    c)  Large memory footprint
    d)  Deterministic behavior

2.  Which operating system structuring method uses a layered approach where each layer relies only on the layers below it? (Understand - Bloom's Taxonomy Level 2)
    a)  Microkernel
    b)  Monolithic kernel
    c)  Hybrid kernel
    d)  Exokernel

**Section 2: Descriptive Questions**

3.  Describe the trade-offs between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling algorithms.  Provide examples of each type. (Analyze - Bloom's Taxonomy Level 4)

4.  Compare and contrast the impact of security considerations on the design of operating systems for embedded systems versus cloud-based systems. (Evaluate - Bloom's Taxonomy Level 5)

**Section 3: Diagram-Based Question**

5.  Draw a diagram illustrating the different states a process can be in during process scheduling (Ready, Running, Blocked/Waiting), including transitions between states and the events triggering those transitions. (Create - Bloom's Taxonomy Level 6)


**Section 4: Application-Based Question**

6. Explain how Deadlock can occur and describe the four necessary conditions for a deadlock to happen and what measures can be taken to prevent deadlocks. (Apply - Bloom's Taxonomy Level 3)
