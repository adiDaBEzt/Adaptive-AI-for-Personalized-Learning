# 🎓 Crew AI: Multi-Agent Educational Orchestration Framework with Bloom’s Taxonomy

**Empowering Education through Modular Agentic Intelligence**

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Crew AI** is a **modular, GenAI-driven educational system** that leverages **agent orchestration frameworks**, **cognitive taxonomies**, and **generative content pipelines** to deliver dynamic, personalized learning pathways.

Built on top of **CrewAI** and **Langflow**, this system is designed for **cognition-aware education delivery**, supporting adaptive content creation, real-time assessments, and explainable AI-based feedback.

---

## 🧠 Key Innovation

✅ **Agentic AI**: Specialized agents operating within modular “crews”  
✅ **Cognitive Alignment**: Full-stack integration with **Bloom’s Taxonomy**  
✅ **GenAI Toolchain**: Uses **LLMs**, **RAG pipelines**, and **DALL·E** for multimodal output  
✅ **Langflow Integration**: Visual low-code orchestration of complex agent workflows  
✅ **Multi-agent Reasoning**: Enhanced throughput and reasoning accuracy vs monolithic LLMs  
✅ **LLMOps-Ready**: Scalable architecture for experimentation and deployment

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

At the heart of the system lies **CrewAI**, an agent orchestration framework, managing specialized sub-agents organized into three core crews:

| Crew Name        | Agents (Roles)                                                     |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Chapter Crew** | Syllabus Analyzer Agent, Content Dev Agent                        |
| **Content Crew** | RAG Expert Agent, Web Researcher, DALL·E Visual Agent             |
| **Testing Crew** | Bloom Taxonomy Question Developer, Cognition Grader               |

These agents are orchestrated through **Langflow** for visual modular flow design and task chaining.

## 🌐 Langflow: No-Code + Modular Workflows

Langflow enabled rapid prototyping of:
- Content Crew pipeline with visual branching.
- Test Crew’s adaptive grading using LLM embeddings.
- Real-time assessment dashboards.

> _“Langflow allowed us to design and deploy agentic systems visually, integrating LangChain and RAG without extensive boilerplate code.”_
