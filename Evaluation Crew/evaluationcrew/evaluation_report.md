   - **Strengths:** Clear understanding of scheduling algorithms, providing a detailed comparison.
   - **Areas for Improvement:** None evident in this response.
   - **Score:** 5/7

4. **Question 4:** "Compare and contrast the impact of security considerations on the design of operating systems for embedded systems versus cloud-based systems." (Evaluate - Level 5)
   - **Student Answer:** Provided a comparison focusing on security aspects.
   - **Cognitive Level:** Level 5 - Evaluating
   - **Evaluation:** The student effectively compared the security requirements, showing depth in evaluation and understanding.
   - **Strengths:** Comprehensive assessment of security differences.
   - **Areas for Improvement:** Include more specific examples of security technologies used.
   - **Score:** 6/7

5. **Question 5:** "Draw a diagram illustrating the different states a process can be in during process scheduling." (Create - Level 6)
   - **Student Answer (Image):** Handwritten notes included states and transitions.
   - **Cognitive Level:** Level 6 - Creating
   - **Evaluation:** The transcribed notes show understanding and creativity in outlining process states.
   - **Strengths:** Creativity and clear illustration of process states.
   - **Areas for Improvement:** Ensure diagrams are well-labeled for clarity.
   - **Score:** 6/7

6. **Question 6:** "Explain how Deadlock can occur and describe the four necessary conditions for a deadlock to happen and what measures can be taken to prevent deadlocks." (Apply - Level 3)
   - **Student Answer:** Detailed explanation of deadlock conditions.
   - **Cognitive Level:** Level 3 - Applying
   - **Evaluation:** Demonstrated a solid application of knowledge to explain and suggest measures for deadlock prevention.
   - **Strengths:** In-depth understanding with detailed conditions and preventive measures.
   - **Areas for Improvement:** None significant; strong response.
   - **Score:** 5/7

**Overall Performance:**

- Cognitive Level Engagement:
  - Remembering: Weak engagement
  - Understanding: Moderate engagement
  - Applying: Strong engagement
  - Analyzing: Very strong engagement
  - Evaluating: Excellent engagement
  - Creating: Excellent engagement

- **Overall Assessment:** 5.0/7.0
- **Recommendations for Improvement:** Focus on improving memorization and understanding foundational concepts to strengthen the cognitive base at lower Bloom's levels.

The student shows a strong grasp of higher-order cognitive processes, but could benefit from reinforcing basic knowledge and understanding layers for a comprehensive skill set across all Bloom's Taxonomy levels.
