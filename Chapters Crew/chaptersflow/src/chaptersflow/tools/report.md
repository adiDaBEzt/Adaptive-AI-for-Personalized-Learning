**Module 1: Algorithm Analysis (8 hours)**

**Chapter 1: Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures (1 hour)**

This introductory chapter lays the groundwork for the entire module.  Students will gain a foundational understanding of what constitutes an algorithm and its crucial role in problem-solving.  We will explore algorithms beyond the purely computational, showing real-world examples to illustrate their ubiquitous nature.  The chapter then introduces the concept of data structures, emphasizing their intimate relationship with algorithm efficiency.  We will briefly explore several fundamental data structures, including arrays and linked lists, setting the stage for more in-depth discussions in later chapters.  By the end of this chapter, students will be able to define algorithms, explain the importance of efficient algorithms, and identify the purpose and types of common data structures.  This chapter serves as a prerequisite for all subsequent chapters.

**Key Topics and Subtopics:**

*   What is an algorithm? (Definition, examples from everyday life)
*   The importance of efficient algorithms (Time and resource saving)
*   Introduction to data structures: purpose and relationship to algorithms
*   Brief overview of arrays: structure, access, advantages and disadvantages
*   Brief overview of linked lists: structure, access, advantages and disadvantages (introducing the concept of nodes and pointers)


**Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Algorithm Analysis: Time and Space Complexity (2 hours)**

Building upon Chapter 1's introduction to algorithms and data structures, this chapter delves into the critical aspects of algorithm analysis: time and space complexity.  Students will learn how to measure and analyze the efficiency of simple algorithms, focusing on quantifying both the time taken and the memory used.  The chapter introduces the Big O notation informally, providing an intuitive understanding of how to express the complexity of algorithms.  Through practical examples (linear search, sequential search), students will gain hands-on experience analyzing algorithm runtime and relating it to different Big O complexities (O(1), O(n), O(n^2)).  This chapter is essential for understanding the subsequent chapters on asymptotic notations and the selection of appropriate algorithms for different tasks.

**Key Topics and Subtopics:**

*   Measuring algorithm efficiency: Time complexity and Space complexity (Definitions and examples)
*   Analyzing runtime of simple algorithms (Linear search, Sequential search – step-by-step analysis)
*   Introduction to Big O notation (Intuitive explanation, focusing on the dominant terms and growth rate)
*   Examples of algorithms with different time complexities (O(1), O(n), O(n^2), illustrating with code snippets and analysis)


**Chapter 3: Asymptotic Notations and Orders of Growth (2 hours)**

This chapter formalizes the concepts introduced in Chapter 2, providing a rigorous definition of asymptotic notations: Big O, Big Omega, and Big Theta. Students will learn to analyze algorithm complexity precisely using these notations, moving beyond the informal introduction in the previous chapter. The chapter explores different orders of growth (logarithmic, linear, quadratic, exponential), comparing their implications for algorithm scalability.  This understanding is crucial for choosing the most efficient algorithm for a given problem and predicting its performance under varying input sizes.  This chapter directly builds on the foundational knowledge of algorithm analysis from Chapter 2.

**Key Topics and Subtopics:**

*   Formal definition of Big O, Big Omega, and Big Theta notations (Mathematical definitions and examples)
*   Analyzing algorithm complexity using Big O, Big Omega, and Big Theta (Step-by-step analysis of algorithms using these notations)
*   Comparing different orders of growth (Logarithmic, linear, quadratic, exponential – graphical representations and comparisons)
*   Understanding the implications of different orders of growth on algorithm scalability (Practical implications and examples)


**Chapter 4: Doubly Linked Lists (1.5 hours)**

Chapter 4 transitions from algorithm analysis to the in-depth study of specific data structures.  Building upon the brief introduction to linked lists in Chapter 1, this chapter focuses on doubly linked lists.  Students will learn the structure and functionality of doubly linked lists, mastering the implementation of basic operations such as insertion (at beginning, end, middle), deletion (from beginning, end, middle), and traversal.  A direct comparison with singly linked lists highlights the advantages and disadvantages of the doubly linked list structure. This chapter serves as a foundation for Chapter 5 on circular linked lists and Chapter 6 on polynomial manipulation.

**Key Topics and Subtopics:**

*   Structure of a doubly linked list node (Diagrammatic representation and code structure)
*   Implementing insertion (at beginning, end, middle – code examples and step-by-step explanations)
*   Implementing deletion (from beginning, end, middle – code examples and step-by-step explanations)
*   Traversing a doubly linked list (Code examples and explanation of forward and backward traversal)
*   Comparison with singly linked lists (Advantages and disadvantages of each approach)


**Chapter 5: Circular Linked Lists (1 hour)**

This chapter extends the knowledge gained in Chapter 4 on linked lists by introducing circular linked lists.  Students will learn the structure and functionality of circular linked lists, implementing basic operations like insertion and deletion. The chapter emphasizes the unique aspects of traversing a circular linked list and identifies specific applications where circular linked lists are particularly advantageous (e.g., circular buffers, round-robin scheduling). This chapter builds directly upon the understanding of doubly linked lists developed in Chapter 4.

**Key Topics and Subtopics:**

*   Structure of a circular linked list (Diagrammatic representation and code structure)
*   Implementing insertion and deletion in a circular linked list (Code examples and step-by-step explanations)

**Chapter 6: Application: Polynomial Manipulation (0.5 hours)**

This final chapter provides a practical application of the data structures learned in Chapters 4 and 5.  Students will learn how to represent polynomials using linked lists, where each node represents a term of the polynomial.  The chapter focuses on implementing algorithms for polynomial addition and multiplication, directly applying the knowledge of linked list manipulation. This chapter reinforces the concepts from previous chapters and demonstrates the practical utility of data structures in solving real-world problems.

**Key Topics and Subtopics:**
